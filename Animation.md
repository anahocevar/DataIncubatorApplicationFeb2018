A spatio-temporal animation of rat intervention events where rodenticide was applied and rat sighting events. Each point in the animation corresponds to a rat sighting (in crimson) or a baiting intervention event (in aqua). The animation displays that while rat sightings occur across the city, they are distributed very non-uniformly. It also shows rich dynamics with oscillatory behavior and an overall increase of number of events.
