<H3>NYC Rat Sightings Project </H3>
<br>

Rats are a large problem in New York City. They present a health threat, can contaminate food, spread diseases and reduce quality of life. They can also damage utilities and contribute to the erosion of buildingsâ€™ structural integrity. In the last years the rat population in the city increased as New Yorkers logged more than 17,200 sightings in 2016, up from 12,600 in 2014. In an attempt to reduce the number of NYC rats mayor Bill de Blasio just last year declared to dedicate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/nyregion/new-york-city-rat-problem.html">$32 million </a> to fight the most problematic rat areas in the city. <br>

In my project I am exploring rat sightings across New York City reported via the 311 system. I have a dataset that contains 
<p style="color:#800000";>reported rat sightings</p> since 2010 until today (in total around 110 000 logged events) and a dataset that contains rodent interventions/inspections in the city, also since 2010 until today (in total around 1.3 million logged events). This totals to <b>around 380MB of data</b>. Both datasets (among other things) contain locations of a sighting or intervention, time of event and type. <br><br><br>
I am interested in exploring and understanding the dynamics of rat sightings across time and how they couple to intervention events. The ultimate goal of my project is:<br>
(i) to asses the effect of rat interventions, in particular the effect of increased interventions since 2017<br>
(ii) choose and test different models for this system (simple linear regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest) <br>
(iii) make predictions and inform how best to distribute future interventions<br>
If needed I also plan to include weather data, socioeconomic data on individual NYC neighborhoods and if obtainable a New York City Department of Sanitation schedule or log of garbage collections, all of which I expect will improve my model.

So far I extracted intervention events where rodenticide was applied and rat sighting events and I created a spatio-temporal animation of these two as seen in the gif below. Each point in the animation corresponds to a rat sighting (in crimson) or a baiting intervention event (in aqua). The animation displays that while rat sightings occur across the city, they are distributed very non-uniformly. It also shows rich dynamics with oscillatory behavior and an overall increase of the number of events over the years.

That is even more visible in the two plots below - the top plot shows the number of rat sightings and interventions per month as a function of time and clearly demonstrates that the number of rat sighting (in crimson) oscillates and on average increases as does the number of interventions (in aqua) which shows a noticeable increase starting

in 2016. The bottom plot shows the average number of rat sightings and interventions per week for a given year. I look at weekly number of rat sightings in years 2010-2013 and compare them using a one-way ANOVA. The obtained p-value equals 0.9642 as is denoted on the bottom plot. From 2013 on I compare weekly number of rat sightings in each year with the year prior by using a two-sample t-tests. The p-values denoted in the bottom plot show that the increase of rat sightings per week in 2014 compared to 2013 is statistically significant. <b> From 2013 on, the difference in the number of rat sightings in a given year compared to the year prior is statistically significant.</b>  As the average number of rat sightings per week has increased, the average number of rat baitings has increased as well, but only starting in 2016 when there were on average 51% more weekly baitings than the year before and in 2017 when there were 47% more baiting interventions per week than the year before.<br>
I then compared the slope of rat sightings increase bewteen consecutive years after 2013 and the results show that the slope does not change from one year to the next (slope = 41.3 std err = 3.6), from which I can conclude that from 2013 on the rate of growth has been constant. Which is not exponential growth in which case the increase in numbers is proportional to the population size so the rate of change is not constant. Exponential growth has fixed percent increase at regular time intervals. What I see here is that the number of rat sightings began to increase in 2014 and in 2016 the City ramped up the number of rat interventions. What followed was that instead of observing the rate of growth of rat sightings curve up in the years after the number of rat sightings started growing, the growth rate remains constant. So this could be a consequence of the City coming up with more interventions, this "arrested" growth does coincide with a large increase of interventions, but it could also have to do with other factors of course, like saturation of natural habitat, etc.
<br><br>
Now I want to explore the City's strategy a bit, how they distribute interventions in time and space. I will first check how the number of weekly baiting interventions is related to the number of weekly rat sightings when summed across the whole city. Does the City respond to a week with more rat sightings with more baiting interventions that week?
