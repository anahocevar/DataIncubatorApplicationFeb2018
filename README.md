NYC Rat Sightings
<br><br><br>

In my project I will explore reported rat sightings across New York City. I found a dataset that contains reported rat sightings since 2010 until today and a dataset that contains rodent interventions/inspections in the city, also since 2010 until today. Both dataset (among other things) contain locations of a sighting or intervention, time of event and type.
