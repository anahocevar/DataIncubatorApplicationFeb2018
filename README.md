<H3>NYC Rat Sightings </H3>
<br>

Rats are a large problem in New York City. They present a health threat, can contaminate food, spread diseases and reduce quality of life. They can also damage utilities and contribute to the erosion of buildingsâ€™ structural integrity. In the last years the rat population in the city increased as New Yorkers logged more than 17,200 sightings in 2016, up from 12,600 in 2014. In an attempt to reduce the number of NYC rats mayor Bill de Blasio just last year declared to dedicate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/nyregion/new-york-city-rat-problem.html">$32 million </a> to fight the most problematic rat areas in the city. <br>

In my project I am exploring rat sightings across New York City reported via the 311 system. I have a dataset that contains reported rat sightings since 2010 until today (in total around 110 000 logged events) and a dataset that contains rodent interventions/inspections in the city, also since 2010 until today (in total around 1.3 million logged events). This totals to around 380MB of data. Both datasets (among other things) contain locations of a sighting or intervention, time of event and type. <br><br><br>
I am interested in exploring and understanding the dynamics of rat sightings across time and how they couple to intervention events. The ultimate goal of the project is:<br>
(i) to asses the effect of rat interventions, in particular the effect of increased interventions since 2017<br>
(ii) choose and test different models for this system (simple linear regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest) <br>
(iii) make predictions and inform how best to distribute future interventions<br>
If needed I also plan to include weather data, socioeconomic data on individual NYC neighborhoods and if obtainable a New York City Department of Sanitation schedule or log of garbage collections, all of which I expect to improve my model.

So far I extracted intervention events where rodenticide was applied and rat sighting events and I created a spatio-temporal animation of these two as seen in the gif below. Each point in the animation corresponds to a rat sighting (in crimson) or a baiting intervention event (in aqua). The animation displays that while rat sightings occur across the city, they are distributed very non-uniformly. It also shows rich dynamics with oscillatory behavior and an overall increase of number of events over the years.

That is even more visible in the plot on the right which shows the total number of rat sightings and interventions each month. The number of rat sighting oscillates and on average increases as does the number of interventions which shows a noticeable increase after the middle of 2016.
